# Code and data for
## Movement of a Heliconius hybrid zone over 30 years: a Bayesian approach

### About

This GitHub repository contains the code (and most of the data) needed to recreate the analysis and manuscript of:

Thurman, T.J., Szejner-Sigal, A., McMillan, W.O. Movement of a *Heliconius* hybrid zone over 30 years: a Bayesian approach. In press, *Journal of Evolutionary Biology*.

### Structure

The project is set up as an Rstudio poject. You can open it in Rstudio by opening the `hz_jeb.Rproj` file. There are five top-level folders. Each folder contains a `README` with more data on the files within that folder:

* **manuscript**- The R markdown files necessary to generate the manuscript and supplemental material. 
* **processed_data**- Processed data files for analysis.
* **raw_data**- Unprocessed data. 
* **results**- Figures, tables, and `.Rdata` files containing the results of analyses. 
* **src**- `R` and `Stan` code that we have written for this project. This includes code to process raw data, generate figures, and do analysis. 

### Questions

If you have questions about the data, please contact Timothy Thurman at either [timothy.j.thurman@gmail.com] or [timothy.thurman@mail.mcgill.ca].
