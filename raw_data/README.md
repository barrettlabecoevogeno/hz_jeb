# raw data

This folder contains raw, unprocessed data for further analysis.

The `blum_2002` folder contains the raw butterfly collection data taken from table 1 of:

Blum, M. J. 2002. Rapid movement of a Heliconius hybrid zone: Evidence for phase III of Wright's shifting balance theory? Evolution 56:1992–1998.

The `canal_shapes` folder contains shapefiles of water bodies within Panama, used to generate the map in figure 1. They were downloaded from http://www.diva-gis.org/gData.

The `collection_sites_2015.csv` file contains the GPS coordinates for the sites and subsites at which we sampled in 2015.

The `erato_collected_2015.csv` file contains data on every *H. erato* we collected in the hybrid zone in 2015.

The `mallet_1986` folder contains the raw butterfly collection data taken from table 4 of:

Mallet, J. 1986. Hybrid zones of Heliconius butterflies in Panama and the stability and movement of warning colour clines. Heredity 56:191–202.

The `forest cover` folder is empty. It should contain the `.tif` files containing the data on NDVI, deltaNDVI, and forest cover loss, but they are too large (1.6 Gb) to host on GitHub. See the supplemental material for information on where to download the forest cover data and information on the processing steps we took to generate the files we analyzed.
